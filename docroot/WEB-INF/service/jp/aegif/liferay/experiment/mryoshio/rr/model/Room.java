/**
 * The model interface for the Room service. Represents a row in the &quot;rr_Room&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link jp.aegif.liferay.experiment.mryoshio.rr.model.impl.RoomImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a room model instance should use the {@link Room} interface instead.
